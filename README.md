As part of my Computer Science Programming module in Year 1, I was tasked with creating a program that utilised C++. I wanted to challenge myself and make software with a GUI as I had little experience in doing so. I decided to learn and use Qt Creator in conjunction with knowledge gained during the module to produce this music player. Users can create custom playlists and save them for later listening.
